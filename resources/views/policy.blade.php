          <strong> This service ("Service(s)" including but not limited to the online social game The Last Stand: Dead Zone Revive) is a fan-made project and is not affiliated with Con Artist Games Pty Ltd ("Con Artist Games", “we" or “us"). This project is entirely non-commercial, and no profits are being made. The privacy of you (the “Player" or “User") while using our Service is of the utmost importance to us. <br />
            <br /> Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. <br />
            <br />
            <br /> INFORMATION WE GATHER AND TRACK <br />
          </strong> We gather the following types of information about users: <br />
          <br /> Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, to share alerts via Facebook, and from participation in polls and surveys. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Optional Voluntary Information</strong>
          <br /> We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users: <br />
          <br />
          <strong>1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</strong>
          <br /> We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We gather the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>2. “Sharing" policy</strong>
          <br /> Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by clicking “email this to a friend" or “share". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient in case an email is sent. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Children</strong>
          <br /> Consistent with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Usage Tracking</strong>
          <br /> We track user traffic patterns throughout our Service. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We assess metrics gathered from the Service to alter the function of the Service, report findings internally, and share publicly. In reporting findings, no specific personal data will be highlighted. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Cookies</strong>
          <br /> We may place a text file called a “cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, cookies are needed to participate actively in message boards, forums, and surveys. <br />

          <br />
          <strong>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</strong>
          <br /> We use the information to tailor content to suit your needs and help advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. We do not share personal information about individual users except as required by law or to protect user safety. <br />
